# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `index.html`: App shell and UI overlays (menu, start/info/gameover screens).
- `src/main.js`: Phaser game logic, input handling, audio, and UI wiring.
- `src/style.css`: Global styling, neon theme, and UI layout.
- `dist/`: Build output (generated by Vite).
- `node_modules/`: Dependencies (generated).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start the Vite dev server with hot reload.
- `npm run build`: Create a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: Serve the production build locally for verification.
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint across the project.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use 2-space indentation in HTML, CSS, and JS to match existing files.
- Use ES modules (`import ... from`) and keep double quotes for strings.
- Prefer descriptive, domain-specific names (e.g., `playerPaddle`, `aiConfig`).
- Keep UI text in `TRANSLATIONS` and bind via `data-i18n` attributes.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test framework is configured yet.
- If adding tests, document the framework and add a `tests/` directory with clear naming (e.g., `pong.scene.test.js`).
- For now, validate changes by running `npm run dev` and `npm run preview`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages in history are short, imperative sentences (e.g., "Add fullscreen mode and language switching").
- Keep commits focused on a single concern and describe the user-visible change.
- PRs should include a brief description, steps to verify, and screenshots for UI changes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets or environment-specific files.
- Keep build artifacts (`dist/`) and dependencies (`node_modules/`) out of version control.
